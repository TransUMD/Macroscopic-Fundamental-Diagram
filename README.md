# Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram
Retrieving Accumulation, Production and Outflow simulated in Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO).

Demand: Random demand generated by random number that can be defined for each simulation period.

Traffic Signal Control: Default Two Phase Plan

How to Run? 
(1) Run NetGenerator.py in Spyder.
(2) Open SUMO Command Line and copy the script in NETCONVERT.txt and run. (Note that the directory should be changed).
(3) Run SUMOSimulation.py.

Output: 
(1)accum   (Accumulation)
(2)produc  (Production)
(3)outfl   (Outflow)
